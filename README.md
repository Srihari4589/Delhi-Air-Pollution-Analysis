# Delhi-Air-Pollution-Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze how air pollution in Delhi, which we measure primarily through PM2.5 and AQI, has evolved over the past decade, and to understand how extreme pollution events are inﬂuenced by meteorological conditions, government policy interventions, and public response.
